### What is data analysis?
> The process of analyzing raw data to find trends and insights which can help in making decisions which can benefit any one.
> In data analysis, we perform various operations like obtaining raw data, organizing and cleaning it, storing it in an 
> accessible place, modeling, and then analyzing data to extract insights that support decision-making.


### What tools are used in data analysis?
> For analysis of data, a Data Analyst requires many tools to gather insights from data.Some of the important tools are:

  * **Power BI** : Power BI provides interactive visualizations with self-service business intelligence capabilities, where 
                 end users can create dashboards and reports by themselves, without having to depend on anybody.
    
  * **Tableau** : Tableau is also a Business Intelligence tool used to analyze and visualize data in an easy format. Tableau 
                allows you to work on live data-set and spend more time on Data Analysis rather than Data Wrangling.
       
  * **Microsoft Excel** : Microsoft Excel is a platform that will help you get better insights into your data. Being one of 
                        the most popular tools for Data Analytics, Microsoft Excel provides the users with features such as 
                        sharing workbooks, work on the latest version for real-time collaboration, and adding data to Excel 
                        directly from a photo and so on.
                      
  * **Python** :  Python is a programming language with a wide range of uses. It has a huge range of resource libraries suited 
                to a variety of different data analytics tasks. For example, the NumPy and pandas libraries are great for 
                streamlining highly computational tasks, as well as supporting general data manipulation. Libraries like 
                Beautiful Soup and Scrapy are used to scrape data from the web, while Matplotlib is excellent for data 
                visualization and reporting.
            
  * **Jupyter Notebook** : Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create interactive documents.
                          These combine live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebook runs in the 
                          browser and supports over 40 languages, including Python and R.
                          
  * **Microsoft PowerPoint** : PowerPoint is computer software created by Microsoft which allows the user to create slides with 
                              recordings, narrations, transitions and other features in order to present information. It is used
                              by data analyst to present insights gathered from data analysis.
